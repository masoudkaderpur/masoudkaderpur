# High-Performance Software Engineering | AI & ML Student

I am a Computer Science student at **TU Wien**, focused on building efficient, unique, and professional software solutions. My approach is defined by "Less is More", prioritizing deep architectural understanding and performance over quantity.

### Technical Focus
* **Core:** Java (Performance-near), Python (AI/ML)
* **Interests:** Observability, Algorithm Optimization, Rechnerarchitektur
* **Systems:** Docker, Unix, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

### Academic Context (TU Wien)
Currently in my 2nd semester, specializing in the intersection of **High-Performance Systems** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I apply academic theorems (Mathematical Analysis, Algorithms & Data Structures, Computer Systems & Structures, Advanced Programming Concepts) directly to production-grade code.

### Featured Project: [CrypticCore Engine](https://github.com/masoudkaderpur/CrypticCore-Engine)
A high-throughput Java encryption engine optimized for $O(1)$ memory consumption and hardware-level cache efficiency.
